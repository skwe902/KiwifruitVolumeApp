# Kiwifruit Volume Measuring App

Written by **Andy Kweon** <br />

This project was done during my internship at GPS-it as a machine leaning intern.

## Aim of the Project:

The aim of the project was to create an ios app that could measure the volume of a kiwifruit just by the user turning on the app and pointing their phone at the fruit. 

The inspiration was from the well-known "measurement" app that Apple has made, which could be downloaded here: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/measure/id1383426740

## Project Outline:
Initially, I have planned the app in three stages:

**Stage 1:** Recreate the measurement app using ARKit framework <br />
**Stage 2:** Implement machine learning using CoreML <br />
**Stage 3:** Utilize Lidar technology <br />

I will explain the implementation in each of these stages and some of the challenges that I have faced in more detail below.

## Stage 1: Basic Measurement App

The measurement app has already been made by quite a lot of people, but the one that I took reference from was this: https://github.com/gualtierofrigerio/SwiftUIARKit

I wanted to use SwiftUI to make the UI instead of Storyboard, just to let the project to be a lot more manageable in the future. 

## Stage 2: Implementing Machine Learning

## Stage 3: Utilizing Lidar & depth measurements
